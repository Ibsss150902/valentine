      <h2>My Valentine ❤️</h2>
      <p>
  <strong>To my love, my soulmate, my wife — Shaik Bushra Tabassum ❤️</strong><br><br>

  Meri jaan, my sweet girl, my life, my strongest woman —  
  reading your words melted my heart. Every line reminded me how blessed I am to have you as my wife, my partner, my best friend, and my forever 💗<br><br>

  From the day you entered my life, everything changed.  
  You brought color, peace, and purpose into my world.  
  You stood by me through every high and low, every laugh and tear —  
  and even at my worst, you chose to love me. For that, I am forever grateful.<br><br>

  These nine months with you have been nothing short of magical.  
  From late-night talks to silly moments, from fights to hugs  
  every memory with you is precious. I miss your “kuchii puchiii,”  
  your naughty smiles, and those little things you do without even realizing how much they mean to me 🥺<br><br>

  You say I made you strong, but the truth is — you make me stronger every single day.  
  You are my reason for faith, my strength, and my peace.  
  Don’t worry, my love — your man is always with you, no matter the distance.<br><br>

  Please don’t say sorry, meri jaan.  
  Love isn’t about perfection it’s about being real, and you are my most beautiful reality.  
  This distance is only temporary. I’m waiting for the day I hold you again and make every moment apart disappear.<br><br>

  I’m proud of you, of how far you’ve come, and of the woman you’re becoming.  
  I’ll always stand by you, wherever life takes us.<br><br>

  <strong>I am in love with my wife always and forever 💗</strong><br><br>

  Until we meet again, remember:  
  you live in my heart, in every breath I take.<br><br>

  Forever yours,<br>
  <strong>Shaik Mohammed Ibrahim 💗</strong>
